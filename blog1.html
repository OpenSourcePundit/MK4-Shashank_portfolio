            <h3>First demo blog</h3>
            <small>23 Movember 2022|18:06</small>
                <p>This is the first blog ..long and random text below.And most of the time, you'll hear an answer that sounds something like this: "However long it needs to be."

                    There's certainly a nugget of truth in there â€” you shouldn't beholden yourself to a character count that's either too low or too high. However, any experienced blogger will tell you that there is an ideal length or range for how long your blog posts should be, especially when you take certain criteria into account like your audience, the topic, the structure of the post, and what your main promotional channel is.
                    
                    We've published thousands of blog posts here at HubSpot, and we analyzed our top-performing ones to see how blog post length impacts success in all of these areas.
                    
                    Read on to see how long your blog posts should be in 2020.</p>
